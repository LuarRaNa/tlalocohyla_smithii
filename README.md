These keyboards were my inspiration:

```mermaid
graph LR;
    A[Horizon] --> B[ChocV];
    click A "https://github.com/skarrmann/horizon" "Go to";
    click B "https://github.com/brickbots/chocV" "Go to";
    C[Hummingbird] --> D[Rufous];
    B --> E[Smithii];
    D --> E[Smithii];
    click C "https://github.com/PJE66/hummingbird" "Go to";
    click D "https://github.com/jcmkk3/trochilidae" "Go to";
```

In a nutshell...
- I really liked the Horizon/ChocV construction design and the end result of a low-profile case, just PCBs, nuts and screws.
- And I also liked the Hummingbird/Rufous 30-key layout and the awesome Xiao BLE to package a full Bluetooth keyboard powered by ZMK firmware.
